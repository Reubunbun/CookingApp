# CookingApp

The aim of this was to use the api found here https://www.themealdb.com/api.php to create a simple web app that allows you to search for and save recipes.
Currently you can use the search bar at the top to search for a query, view a list of recipes matching the query, view full details of a recipe and finally save the recipe. You can go back to saved recipes by clicking the link at the top-left.
I didn't use node to make this so there is no package.json, I just downloaded .js files and ran everything locally. All files I downloaded are in the /js/libs folder.
